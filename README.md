# Approach to a Sick Patient
Get early help with a deteriorating patient. Escalate to your registrar, consultant, ICU or activate a MET call. Commence simultaneous assessment and treatment.
- [] Airway - check for patency, then for protection from aspiration. Simple airway manoeuvres: head tilt, chin lift, jaw thrust ± oro/nasopharngeal airway to re-open. Airawy problems usually indicate the need to call an arrest. A GCS ≤ 8 generally means the airway is no longer protected.
- [] Breathing - check the respiratory rate, work of breathing & adequacy of respiration, i.e. oxygen saturation. Provide oxygen as required. Check trachea is midline & auscultate the chest for equal breath sounds & obvious abnormalities.
